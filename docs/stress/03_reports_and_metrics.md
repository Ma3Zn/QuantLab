# Stress — Reports and metrics (MVP)

## StressReport contents
Per scenario:
- total P&L
- ΔNAV
- return (P&L / NAV)
- top drivers (absolute contributions)

Breakdowns:
- by position
- by asset id
- by currency (if meaningful)

Summary:
- worst scenario id + max loss
- distribution summary across scenarios (min/median/max)

## Honesty constraints
Scenario-set “tail” metrics are not probabilities and are not VaR.
Report must include this explicitly.
